# Daily private TestFlight release

Autopilot's supported scheduler starts one bounded agent session daily at
22:00 `Australia/Perth` (`0 22 * * *`, 14:00 UTC). The enabled trigger stores
the full execution contract, repository paths, identity and reporting route.
No Autopilot restart is needed for scheduler CRUD.

## Authentication and release gates

The API integration reads a private owner-only credential reference and signs
short-lived ES256 tokens. It verifies the exact app, complete paginated build
and upload history, and pinned existing private group and sole tester. Native
Xcode archive/export/upload receives only the authorized key reference, key ID
and issuer ID. Never print PEM, JWT or Authorization headers. Python uses the
host CA bundle (on macOS `/etc/ssl/cert.pem`); TLS verification is mandatory.

Install the pinned Python dependencies in a private virtual environment before
running the API actions:

```sh
python3 -m venv "$RELEASE_VENV"
"$RELEASE_VENV/bin/python" -m pip install -r tools/ios/requirements-testflight.txt
```

Keep the environment and local reference under ignored operational storage.
The reference schema is `schema: 1`, `key_path`, `key_id`, `issuer_id`,
`private_group_id`, and `pete_tester_id`. Verify the group/tester identity live
before pinning their opaque IDs; never match an approximate display name.
Both reference and key must be owner-only regular files without symlink paths.

`dry-run` distinguishes `auth.ready` from `auth.release_ready`. Authentication
alone cannot authorize a new upload when Apple processing, an unresolved upload
or a local pending delivery remains. Live read-only validation does not prove
that Xcode API export/upload or group assignment works; the authorized nightly
release is the first opportunity to prove those mutations end to end.

All build and upload numbers, including inactive reservations and failed uploads,
participate in monotonic numbering. Marketing versions include upload history.
`AWAITING_UPLOAD` is not automatically abandoned. A reviewed legacy exception
must pin the exact upload ID, version, number and creation date, plus retained
private evidence and its SHA-256. Every preflight verifies a null uploaded date
and an empty complete upload-file collection; any change fails closed. Local
cancelled runs require an exact state hash and the same retained cancellation
evidence. Existing records remain untouched. New or unmatched pending deliveries
always block release; never delete Apple records or bypass a pending state.

The optional private reference fields `inactive_uploads` and
`reconciled_local_runs` hold these reviewed pins. Each upload rule has `version`,
`build`, `created_at`, `evidence_path`, and `evidence_sha256`; each local run rule
has `state_sha256` and the two evidence fields. Evidence schema 1 pins `app_id`,
`basis: reviewed_inactive_legacy_reservations`, `inactive_uploads` (IDs mapped to
exact version/build/creation facts) and `cancelled_local_runs` (run names mapped
to state hashes). An operator must establish the cancellation facts before
creating a rule; an empty file list alone does not establish cancellation.

## Release execution contract

1. Set a session completion goal and `nextAction=reflect`. Read the task and
   complete current thread, latest comments, all repository agent guides and
   the current release-tool implementation before acting.
2. Run `"$RELEASE_VENV/bin/python" tools/ios/nightly_testflight.py claim`. Save the returned Perth
   day. Duplicate daily claims and any prior active claim fail closed, even
   for the same session. A crash never automatically expires a claim. The
   operator reconciles its session, Apple receipts and run state before any
   explicitly authorized repair. Do not edit the ledger to bypass a gate.
3. Inspect both working trees, staged changes, branch and upstream. Default
   to `main`; stop on another branch, conflicts, incompatible work or moving
   inputs. Preserve unrelated and concurrent files. Never stash, reset,
   rebase, force-push or bypass hooks.
4. Flight Deck comes first. Review all compatible nonignored software and
   reusable documentation, run focused tests and required public-source,
   unit, release-note, build and distribution checks. Follow its release-note
   numbering rules for source changes. Build in an isolated snapshot with
   pinned build number/ID/time so generated metadata cannot dirty shared
   source. Verify the exact tested staged tree remains unchanged, then commit
   a Conventional Commit checkpoint. A clean tree retains its existing commit.
   Push the configured authoritative upstream only as a normal fast-forward
   when safely permitted; divergence/auth failures are blockers, never a reason
   to substitute stale remote source for the newer local commit.
5. Validate WMAPP analysis/tests sequentially and release tooling tests. Review
   and commit all compatible tested nonignored source/docs on `main`, checking
   for concurrent edits before committing. Ignore operational evidence and
   generated bundles. Never stage everything without inspecting the candidates.
6. Check authentication and release gates before expensive packaging. Run
   `nightly_testflight.py dry-run` with the private virtual environment. On
   failure report the exact prerequisite and both source commits, finish as
   `blocked_auth` only for missing/failed auth, otherwise `failed`, and stop.
   Do not ask for a provisioned key again or manufacture readiness.
7. Run `testflight_release.py api-preflight --run <unique-name>`, then
   `api-reserve` with the same run name. Reservation queries fresh history,
   applies Apple/local pending barriers, and reserves a number greater than
   all build/upload/local numbers under the global release lock. API reserve,
   build and upload require this session's active current Perth daily claim.
   Never reuse uncertain numbers or re-upload a pending delivery.
8. Create isolated snapshots of the exact committed Flight Deck and WMAPP trees
   under ignored private evidence. Use `git archive` or a private local clone;
   never build the shared working copy. Install frozen Flight Deck dependencies,
   set `FLIGHT_DECK_PG_APP_NPUB` to the verified Flight Deck app identity from
   the scoped Flight Deck context (local overrides do not set it automatically),
   pin `FLIGHTDECK_BUILD_NUMBER`, `FLIGHTDECK_BUILD_ID`, `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`,
   build and verify `dist`, then pass that snapshot through `FLIGHT_DECK_DIR`
   to the existing WMAPP release workflow. Record commit, version/build and
   asset hashes. Keep generated output in the snapshot, not shared tracked files.
9. Run `testflight_release.py api-build --run <unique-name>` to perform the
   isolated FD-first build and export; then `api-upload` once. Use its barriers
   and signing checks for Runner and Packet Tunnel. Validate the exact exported artifact, archive, profiles, entitlements,
   identifiers, team and matching monotonic build. No upload until every gate
   passes. One upload attempt only; uncertainty requires readback, never retry.
10. App `6809077710`, bundle `com.wingmanbefree.wingmanApp`, existing Pete Private
    internal group, sole Pete and manual distribution remain mandatory. No
    external group, public link, tester invitation or production submission.
    Run `api-readback --run <unique-name> --poll-seconds 600` for bounded processing
    and exact group assignment/readback. Resolve actual standard encryption beyond
    OS crypto accurately using the documented inventory and authorized territories.
    The API never patches encryption flags or reuses an older declaration. If
    Apple requires compliance action, stop and report it; do not invent exemptions
    or change territories. Assign only the exact processed build to the existing
    group and independently read it back. Report `Testing`, `Processing`, action
    required or failure; never call a receipt or IPA a published release.
11. Write one readable result on the originating task and same thread, including
    commits, FD build/assets, Apple build/receipt if any and exact blocker/status.
    Finish with the exact claimed `--day` and `--result blocked_auth|failed|processing|testing`.
    Set `nextAction=stop` only after reporting and handoff. If reporting or upload
    outcome is uncertain, retain the active claim for reconciliation.

Operational prompts, logs, screenshots and receipts belong only in verified
ignored, untracked `tmp/docs/handoffs/`. Check every destination before writing;
reject symlink paths. Preserve existing evidence and verify hashes when moving
it. Do not raise the deployment target for a future nonblocking warning.

## Read-only validation

```sh
"$RELEASE_VENV/bin/python" tools/ios/nightly_testflight.py dry-run
"$RELEASE_VENV/bin/python" -m unittest discover -s tools/tests -p 'test*testflight*.py'
git diff --check
```

The dry run reads branches, commits, status and upstream configuration, checks
required tool availability and the private storage boundary, and reports actual
auth readiness. It never claims a real day, changes a release state or uploads.
Guard tests exercise duplicate claims, overlapping days, owner-only completion
and failure-closed outcomes using temporary fixtures. Read back the live enabled
schedule, timezone, next run, identity, paths and full reporting contract after
activation; do not manually fire a duplicate release merely to test scheduling.

Use the installed `xcodebuild -help` for the supported authentication and export
options. Internal exports require `testFlightInternalTestingOnly=true` and
`manageAppVersionAndBuildNumber=false`; uploading changes only `destination` to
`upload`. API `Testing` verifies Apple status and assignment, while device
visibility remains unverified until the tester confirms the exact build.
