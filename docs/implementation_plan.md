# Wingman App Implementation Plan

Status: active implementation plan
Date: 2026-07-01

## Goal

Build Wingman App as a cross-platform native edge client for Wingman Be Free.

Initial targets:

- macOS.
- Linux.
- Android.
- iPhone/iPad.

Initial capabilities:

- Per-device Nostr key setup.
- NIP-98 signed Tower HTTP requests.
- Tower-backed file browsing/sync.
- Lazy desktop file hydration.
- Docs open as Flight Deck URLs.
- Embedded WApp browser with a native `window.nostr` signer.

## Guiding Constraints

- Tower is the source of truth.
- All auth uses Nostr keys and NIP-98 where HTTP is involved.
- Device keys are Nostr keys with explicit Tower grants.
- WApps never receive raw private keys.
- The shared sync model should work across desktop and mobile.
- Platform file integration is adapter-specific.
- Do not fork Keychat.

## Supporting Documents

- `docs/architecture.md`: product and system architecture.
- `docs/decisions.md`: architecture decision backlog for open/proposed/accepted choices.
- `docs/tower_route_inventory.md`: current Tower route support and gaps for Drive and signer work.
- `docs/tower_drive_contract.md`: Phase 1 file, folder, version, tombstone, and delta contract.
- `docs/device_key_contract.md`: Phase 1 device key and NIP-98 grant contract.
- `docs/api_gap_harness.md`: Phase 1 signed smoke harness and Tower gap tickets.

## Current State

Last reconciled from the Flight Deck board and local repo on 2026-07-01.

Numbering model:

- `WP-*` tasks are client/app implementation packages in this repo unless the package explicitly says otherwise.
- Tower pickup tasks discovered by the Phase 1 API audit are represented inline in the phase they gate.
- `TOWER-GAP-*` labels remain aliases for the existing Flight Deck board tasks until those task titles are renamed or superseded.
- Treat the `WP-*` ID as the canonical ordering key in this document. Preserve the `TOWER-GAP-*` alias in descriptions/comments until the board is fully migrated.

Completed:

- Phase 0 planning baseline and decision backlog.
- Phase 1 Tower route inventory, Drive contract, device-key contract, and signed API smoke harness.
- `WP-01-05` / `TOWER-GAP-01`: Drive tree and delta routes reviewed and accepted.
- `WP-01-06` / `TOWER-GAP-02`: byte-range file content reads reviewed and accepted.
- `WP-02-01`: Rust workspace and `wmapp-core` crate skeleton.
- `WP-02-02`: development device-key generation/import and NIP-98 signer.
- `WP-02-03`: Tower HTTP client and models.
- `WP-02-04`: SQLite index and object cache.
- `WP-02-05`: sync CLI and local control API.

Key commits:

- `bbd7958 Complete wm-app phase 1 contracts`.
- `67ed27d Add wmapp core crate and NIP-98 signer`.
- `3e015a6 Add wmapp Tower HTTP client`.
- `0786732 Add wmapp SQLite index and object cache`.
- `82a3bfb Add wmapp sync control CLI`.
- `0dc9292 Add wmapp drive mount projection`.
- `c6b400a Update wmapp implementation plan status`.
- `776c6a7 Record macFUSE host validation`.
- Tower `e58c874 Add Flight Deck PG Drive tree delta routes`.
- Tower `9f38bb4 Add Flight Deck PG file byte ranges`.

Latest completed package:

- `WP-03-06: NIP-98 Permission Prompt Prototype`.

Current checkpoint:

- Read-only filesystem mount spike has started on macOS. The shared Drive projection, `mount --dry-run` CLI, foreground FUSE/macFUSE mount adapter, and cache-first/Tower-hydrating read path are available. macFUSE 5.2.0 is installed on the current Mac host, but the kernel device still cannot load until host security approval/loading is fixed.
- Phase 3 is implemented and locally validated as a desktop spike across Tower and wm-app: single-channel read, device lifecycle routes, Flutter setup shell, process-backed native bridge, embedded WebView signer injection, and NIP-98 prompt flow are in place. Flutter 3.44.4 is installed on the current Mac, `flutter test`, `flutter build web`, `flutter build macos --debug`, and a brief `flutter run -d macos` all pass.

Active package:

- `WP-04-01: Linux FUSE Adapter Skeleton` is implemented in code but still needs live kernel acceptance. The projection, dry-run surface, foreground adapter, and lazy read hook are committed; the actual `ls ~/FlightDeck` mount acceptance is not complete until the installed macFUSE host driver can load.

Current working assumption:

- Phase 2 is now complete enough for manual testing. The headless core can authenticate, list Tower workspace/scope/channel/file metadata, persist it locally, expose basic sync/control commands, and cache/pin/evict hydrated objects.
- Phase 4 should proceed as a shared FUSE/macFUSE adapter path because the current development host is macOS, while Linux remains the simplest CI/runtime target for first kernel-mount validation.
- Do not promise production write sync until the remaining Tower write/delete/version gap cards are clear.

## Board Status Snapshot

This snapshot mirrors the Flight Deck board as of 2026-07-01. Treat the board as authoritative if a later worker sees a mismatch.

| ID range | Board state | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WP-00-01` to `WP-02-02` | `review` | Repo-local work is complete enough to build from, but board review has not been closed. |
| `WP-02-03` to `WP-02-05` | `done` | Native core read path, SQLite/cache, and headless control CLI are implemented and validated. |
| `WP-04-01` | `in_progress` | Adapter code is implemented; live kernel mount acceptance remains blocked by macFUSE host loading. |
| `WP-01-05` to `WP-01-06` | `done` as `TOWER-GAP-01` to `TOWER-GAP-02` | Read-only Drive route prerequisites are clear. |
| `WP-03-01` to `WP-03-06` | `review` | Phase 3 spike code is in place across Tower and wm-app. Flutter SDK validation now passes on macOS and web build targets. |
| `WP-04-02` to `WP-04-03` | `in_progress` | Projection and lazy read code are implemented and validated through dry-run/cache tests; live mounted `find`/open acceptance waits on macFUSE. |
| `WP-04-04` to `WP-05-*`, `WP-07-*` to `WP-11-*` | `new` | Planned packages, not started except where noted by committed partial work. |
| `WP-06-01` to `WP-06-03` | `ready` as `TOWER-GAP-03` to `TOWER-GAP-05` | Write-sync Tower prerequisites. These must complete before production write sync. |
| `WP-10-01` | `ready` as `TOWER-GAP-08` | WApp trusted origin prerequisite before signer policy work. |

## Inline Tower Pickup Gates

The catch-up trigger correctly surfaced `WMAPP TOWER-GAP-*` cards from the Phase 1 audit. They are cross-repo Tower prerequisites, but they are represented inline in the phase they gate so the implementation plan remains a single ordered sequence without implying every gap blocks the current mount work.

| WP ID | Alias | Board state | Blocks | Pickup guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `WP-01-05` | `TOWER-GAP-01` | `done` | Previously blocked Drive tree/delta reads. | No further pickup needed unless route regressions appear. |
| `WP-01-06` | `TOWER-GAP-02` | `done` | Previously blocked byte-range reads. | No further pickup needed unless range smoke tests fail. |
| `WP-03-01` | `TOWER-GAP-06` | `implemented` | Polished channel lookup and some CLI ergonomics. | Tower now exposes a single-channel read route and wmapp-core has a `channel` validation command. |
| `WP-03-02` | `TOWER-GAP-07` | `implemented` | Production device onboarding/revoke. | Tower now exposes `/api/v4/user/devices` lifecycle routes backed by NIP-98 workspace-user-key grants. |
| `WP-06-01` | `TOWER-GAP-03` | `ready` | `WP-06-*` write sync and conflict-safe overwrites. | Pick up before implementing production uploads or offline edits. |
| `WP-06-02` | `TOWER-GAP-04` | `ready` | `WP-06-*` delete/tombstone behavior. | Pick up before exposing deletes or rename/move semantics. |
| `WP-06-03` | `TOWER-GAP-05` | `ready` | `WP-06-*` version history and conflict UX. | Pick up before claiming version browsing or robust conflict resolution. |
| `WP-10-01` | `TOWER-GAP-08` | `ready` | `WP-10-*` WApp signer policy. | Pick up before granting trusted WApp signing permissions. |

Cleared for the read-only Drive spine:

- `WP-01-05` / `WMAPP TOWER-GAP-01`: Drive tree and delta contract. Status: done.
- `WP-01-06` / `WMAPP TOWER-GAP-02`: byte-range file content reads. Status: done.

These two gaps are now clear enough for `WP-02-03`, `WP-02-04`, `WP-02-05`, and the read-only FUSE work in `WP-04-*` to target the Tower read path directly. `WP-02-03` should model `/drive/tree`, `/drive/delta`, and ranged `/files/:fileId/object` reads as the primary read contracts.

Ready before write support:

- `WP-06-01` / `WMAPP TOWER-GAP-03`: file version replacement with `base_version_id`. Status: ready.
- `WP-06-02` / `WMAPP TOWER-GAP-04`: file and folder tombstones. Status: ready.
- `WP-06-03` / `WMAPP TOWER-GAP-05`: file version listing. Status: ready.

These block `WP-06-*` production write sync, conflict handling, and delete semantics. Do not promise offline writes, overwrite safety, or conflict resolution until these routes are implemented and covered by smoke tests.

Ready before polished device and signer flows:

- `WP-03-01` / `WMAPP TOWER-GAP-06`: single-channel read or documented lookup alternative. Status: ready.
- `WP-03-02` / `WMAPP TOWER-GAP-07`: device-key lifecycle routes. Status: ready.
- `WP-10-01` / `WMAPP TOWER-GAP-08`: trusted WApp origin identity. Status: ready.

`WP-03-01` / `TOWER-GAP-06` is mostly a client ergonomics and reliability gap. `WP-03-02` / `TOWER-GAP-07` gates production device onboarding/revocation beyond development keys. `WP-10-01` / `TOWER-GAP-08` gates signer policy because the native app needs a stable Tower-backed origin identity before granting WApp signing permissions.

## Work Package Index

Each phase is split into numbered work packages. Flight Deck tasks should use the same IDs in their titles so planning, task board state, and repo-local docs can be reconciled without guessing.

### Phase 0: Repo And Design

#### WP-00-01: Repo Seed And Documentation Baseline

Status:

- Complete. The repo has a documentation baseline plus supporting decision and route-inventory docs.

Scope:

- Keep `wm-app` as a standalone repo under `~/code/wingmanbefree/wm-app`.
- Maintain the initial README, architecture, and implementation plan.
- Capture the product boundary: Flutter shell, native core, Tower source of truth, per-platform adapters.

Deliverable:

- Documentation baseline committed in `wm-app`.
- README links to architecture, implementation plan, decision backlog, and route inventory.

Acceptance:

- `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/implementation_plan.md` explain the product shape and first implementation path.
- The repo can be handed to a fresh worker without relying on chat context.

#### WP-00-02: Architecture Decision Backlog

Status:

- Complete. `docs/decisions.md` tracks the current architecture decisions and finalization triggers.

Scope:

- Create a lightweight decision log for major unresolved choices.
- Track decisions for Flutter/Rust split, macFUSE vs File Provider, local daemon API, device key model, and WApp signer policy.

Deliverable:

- `docs/decisions.md` with open, proposed, and accepted decisions.

Acceptance:

- Each open decision includes owner, context, options, recommendation, and trigger for finalizing.

### Phase 1: Tower Storage And Auth Contract Audit

#### WP-01-01: Tower Route Inventory

Status:

- Complete. `docs/tower_route_inventory.md` records current Tower route support and Drive-blocking gaps.

Scope:

- Inspect `wingman-tower` Flight Deck PG task, file, folder, document, storage, and event routes.
- Identify which current routes can support Wingman Drive and which are missing.

Deliverable:

- `docs/tower_route_inventory.md` with current route, method, auth, response suitability, and gaps.

Acceptance:

- The audit covers file listing, file object download, storage upload, file metadata creation, scopes, channels, workspace discovery, and events.

Findings:

- Existing Tower routes are enough for a read-only metadata listing and full-object hydration prototype.
- Production write sync still needs byte-range reads, file/folder deletes, file content version replacement, optimistic `baseVersion`, and a Drive-specific tree/delta or event-consumption contract.

#### WP-01-02: File, Folder, Version, And Delta Contract

Status:

- Complete. `docs/tower_drive_contract.md` defines the Drive metadata, version, tombstone, content, and delta contract.

Scope:

- Define the Tower-side metadata contract required by the sync core.
- Specify stable IDs, folder records, tombstones, version IDs, ETags, object refs, and delta cursor behavior.

Deliverable:

- Draft API contract for file/folder/version/delta routes.

Acceptance:

- The contract supports online-only placeholders, lazy hydration, optimistic writes, conflict detection, and deletes.

Findings:

- The first crate can compose existing file-folder, file, object, and event routes for read-only sync.
- Production writes require Tower to add file versions, content replacement with `base_version_id`, tombstones, range reads, and a Drive delta endpoint or documented event profile.

#### WP-01-03: Device Key And NIP-98 Grant Contract

Status:

- Complete. `docs/device_key_contract.md` defines the device-key model and maps it to current workspace-key routes.

Scope:

- Define how per-device Nostr keys are registered, granted, audited, and revoked in Tower.
- Confirm how Tower resolves a device npub to user/workspace permissions.

Deliverable:

- Device key registration and authorization contract.

Acceptance:

- A revoked device key fails closed.
- A granted device key can sign NIP-98 requests without exposing the user's master key.

Findings:

- Current `/api/v4/user/workspace-keys` routes prove delegated Nostr-key auth but do not yet provide labelled device records, policy, last-seen, or direct revoke UX.
- The native crate should expose device-key abstractions now and feature-gate registration/revocation until Tower adds first-class device routes.

#### WP-01-04: API Gap Harness And Tickets

Status:

- Complete. `tools/tower_drive_smoke.mjs` and `docs/api_gap_harness.md` define the signed smoke flow and Tower follow-up work.

Scope:

- Build or document a small signed script/CLI flow that exercises the current Tower API.
- Convert missing capabilities into follow-up Tower tasks.

Deliverable:

- API smoke-test notes plus a list of Tower gap tasks.

Acceptance:

- A signed request can list visible files and download one file where current APIs support it.
- Missing API routes are captured as explicit follow-up work.

Findings:

- The harness covers workspace discovery, descriptor, `me`, scopes, optional channels, optional file folders/files, events, and optional full file object hydration.
- Tower gap work is captured inline in the phase each gap gates, with `WMAPP TOWER-GAP-*` aliases preserved for existing board records.

#### WP-01-05: Drive Tree And Delta Tower Routes

Alias:

- `WMAPP TOWER-GAP-01`.

Status:

- Complete. Tower commit `e58c874` added the accepted Flight Deck PG Drive tree and delta routes.

Scope:

- Add Tower read routes for Drive tree enumeration and delta cursor reads.
- Ensure the native client can use these routes as the source of truth for online-only placeholders.

Deliverable:

- Tower exposes signed `/drive/tree` and `/drive/delta` routes for Flight Deck PG workspaces.

Acceptance:

- Signed client smoke can list the visible Drive tree.
- Delta route returns a cursor-compatible response for subsequent sync passes.

Findings:

- This unblocked `WP-02-03`, `WP-02-04`, `WP-02-05`, and the current read-only mount path.

#### WP-01-06: Byte Range File Content Reads

Alias:

- `WMAPP TOWER-GAP-02`.

Status:

- Complete. Tower commit `9f38bb4` added byte-range file object reads.

Scope:

- Add ranged content reads for Flight Deck PG file objects.
- Preserve normal full-object reads for simple hydration.

Deliverable:

- Tower can serve `Range` requests for file content.

Acceptance:

- Signed client smoke can request a partial byte range and receive the expected partial response metadata.

Findings:

- This is clear enough for lazy desktop reads, although the first mounted adapter can still start with full-object hydration.

### Phase 2: Native Core Spike

#### WP-02-01: Rust Workspace And Core Crate Skeleton

Status:

- Complete. `crates/wmapp-core` is a compiling Rust crate with auth, Tower client, sync, cache, SQLite, and control module boundaries.

Scope:

- Add the native core project structure.
- Define modules for auth, Tower client, sync, cache, SQLite, and control API.

Deliverable:

- Compilable native core skeleton.

Acceptance:

- Native core builds locally.
- Module boundaries match the architecture document.

Findings:

- The Tower client boundary is read-first and leaves write methods behind `UnsupportedByTowerContract` errors until Tower gap cards land.
- Cache, SQLite, sync, and control modules are intentionally skeletal; WP-02-04 and WP-02-05 will fill them in.

#### WP-02-02: Nostr Key Manager And NIP-98 Signer

Status:

- Complete. `wmapp-core` can generate/import development device keys and sign NIP-98 requests.

Scope:

- Implement device key generation/import.
- Implement NIP-98 signing for Tower HTTP requests.
- Use a development storage backend first, with secure storage adapters planned separately.

Deliverable:

- CLI/API can generate a device npub and sign a NIP-98 request.

Acceptance:

- Generated signatures verify against the device npub.
- NIP-98 payload hashes are included for request bodies.

Findings:

- Device keys round-trip through hex and `nsec`.
- `sign-nip98` emits a `Nostr <base64-json-event>` authorization header.
- Unit tests verify Schnorr signatures and assert the `payload` tag is present for non-empty bodies.

#### WP-02-03: Tower HTTP Client And Models

Status:

- Complete. `crates/wmapp-core` now has typed Tower models, a NIP-98 signed blocking HTTP client, and headless CLI read commands.

Scope:

- Implement typed client calls for workspace discovery, scopes, channels, files, file objects, and events.
- Model Tower responses in native code.

Deliverable:

- Core can call Tower and deserialize workspace/file metadata.

Acceptance:

- `wmapp-core status` and `wmapp-core list-files` work against a configured Tower.

Findings:

- `status` can validate Tower service, workspace discovery, descriptor, and `me` with `TOWER_URL`, `FLIGHTDECK_APP_NPUB`, and a NIP-98 signing key.
- `list-files` targets the accepted `/api/v4/flightdeck-pg/workspaces/:workspaceId/drive/tree` route and prints Drive tree items with file/folder counts.
- The client also models scopes, scope channel lists, Drive delta cursors, full file-object reads, and ranged file-object byte reads.
- Production write sync remains unsupported until `WP-06-01`, `WP-06-02`, and `WP-06-03` are complete.

#### WP-02-04: SQLite Index And Object Cache

Status:

- Complete. `wmapp-core` persists Tower-visible metadata to SQLite and stores hydrated file objects under a content cache.

Scope:

- Add local SQLite schema for accounts, workspaces, scopes, channels, items, versions, cache entries, transfers, permissions, and cursors.
- Add object cache layout and basic eviction metadata.

Deliverable:

- Local metadata index and content cache implementation.

Acceptance:

- A sync pass persists visible metadata.
- A downloaded object can be read from cache after restart.

Findings:

- The SQLite schema covers accounts, workspaces, scopes, channels, Drive items, versions, cache entries, transfers, permissions, and cursors.
- `SyncEngine::persist_visible_metadata` stores workspace, permission, scope/channel, Drive tree, and Drive delta state.
- Object cache writes decoded Tower file objects to a stable local object path, records cache metadata, and can read cached bytes after reopening the index/cache.
- Validation: `cargo test` passed with 13 tests at package handoff; the follow-up WP-02-05 suite now passes with 14 tests.

#### WP-02-05: Sync CLI And Local Control API

Status:

- Complete. The headless CLI exposes the local control surface needed before Flutter/FUSE work.

Scope:

- Add a CLI and/or local control API for status, sync once, list items, cat file, pin, and evict.

Deliverable:

- Headless core can be tested without Flutter.

Acceptance:

- `sync --once` populates metadata.
- `cat <fileId>` streams from cache or Tower.
- `status` reports account, device npub, Tower URL, and sync health.

Findings:

- New commands: `sync --once`, `list-items`, `cat`, `pin`, and `evict`.
- Local state uses `--data-dir`, `WMAPP_DATA_DIR`, or `~/.wmapp` with `index.sqlite` plus a `cache/objects` tree.
- `cat` reads cached bytes first and hydrates from Tower on cache miss when Tower credentials are configured.
- `pin` marks cached files as pinned; `evict` refuses pinned entries unless `--force` is passed.
- Live smoke against local Tower on 2026-07-01 passed for `sync --once`, `list-items`, `cat --output`, `pin`, and `evict` on workspace `2e5caefd-dd65-45d2-b747-ee874e8e5fc9` and channel `d8d00881-ac84-41eb-ab0d-2c2afb77ddf3` using `wmapp-cli-test.txt`.

### Phase 3: Flutter Shell Spike

#### WP-03-01: Single Channel Read Or Contracted Alternative

Alias:

- `WMAPP TOWER-GAP-06`.

Status:

- Implemented. Tower exposes `GET /api/v4/flightdeck-pg/workspaces/:workspaceId/channels/:channelId`, and `wmapp-core channel --workspace-id ... --channel-id ...` validates a configured channel without scanning every scope.

Scope:

- Add a single-channel read route or document the contracted lookup alternative.
- Reduce client need to list all channels before resolving a known channel ID.

Deliverable:

- Tower route or documented contract for resolving one channel by ID.

Acceptance:

- Native and Flutter clients can validate a configured channel without scanning every scope.

Blocks:

- Polished account/channel setup UX. Not a blocker for current read-only mount work.

#### WP-03-02: Device Key Lifecycle Routes

Alias:

- `WMAPP TOWER-GAP-07`.

Status:

- Implemented. Tower exposes `/api/v4/user/devices` register/list/seen/revoke routes as a device-oriented facade over NIP-98 workspace-user-key grants, and `wmapp-core device register/list/seen/revoke` can call them.

Scope:

- Add first-class Tower routes for device key registration, labelling, last-seen tracking, policy, and revocation.
- Preserve NIP-98 semantics: device keys are Nostr keys with explicit grants.

Deliverable:

- Tower device-key lifecycle contract and smoke tests.

Acceptance:

- A registered device key can authenticate according to its grants.
- A revoked device key fails closed without rotating the user's main key.

Blocks:

- Production onboarding and revocation beyond development keys. Early prototypes may continue using development keys.

#### WP-03-03: Flutter App Shell And Account Setup

Status:

- Implemented and locally validated as a desktop spike. The Flutter shell under `app/` has setup, Drive, browser, and status screens, Tower/App/workspace/channel fields, device key generation/import through `wmapp-core`, registration signer separation, device registration, and channel validation.

Scope:

- Create the Flutter app shell.
- Add Tower URL configuration, account setup, key import/generate, and basic navigation.

Deliverable:

- Flutter app launches on at least one desktop target with account setup screens.

Acceptance:

- User can enter Tower URL and create/import a device key.

Current validation:

- `cd app && flutter test`
- `cd app && flutter build web`
- `cd app && flutter build macos --debug`
- `cd app && flutter run -d macos`

#### WP-03-04: Native Bridge To Core Status And Config

Status:

- Implemented as a local-process bridge. `NativeCoreBridge` calls `wmapp-core` for status, local Drive listing, one-shot sync, channel validation, device lifecycle commands, and NIP-98 signing. FFI/platform-channel hardening remains a later production choice.

Scope:

- Connect Flutter to native core through platform channels, FFI, or local control API.
- Expose status, account config, and basic sync commands.

Deliverable:

- Flutter can display native core status and trigger sync.

Acceptance:

- UI shows device npub, Tower URL, and latest sync result from the native core.

#### WP-03-05: Embedded WebView With `window.nostr` Injection

Status:

- Implemented as a Flutter desktop WebView prototype using `webview_flutter`. Trusted origins receive a minimal `window.nostr` bridge with `getPublicKey` and `signNip98`; unknown origins do not receive the bridge.

Scope:

- Add WebView for Flight Deck and WApps.
- Inject a minimal NIP-07-style `window.nostr` bridge for approved origins.

Deliverable:

- Test page can call `window.nostr.getPublicKey()`.

Acceptance:

- Unknown origins do not get the bridge.
- Approved origin receives only the supported methods.

#### WP-03-06: NIP-98 Permission Prompt Prototype

Status:

- Implemented as a native Flutter prompt. The prompt displays origin, URL, HTTP method, event kind `27235`, and device npub before calling `wmapp-core sign-nip98`.

Scope:

- Implement native approval flow for WebView NIP-98 signing requests.
- Add remembered approval for safe Tower auth requests.

Deliverable:

- WebView can request and receive a NIP-98 signature through the native bridge.

Acceptance:

- The prompt shows origin, URL, method, event kind, and device npub before approval.

### Phase 4: Linux FUSE Read-Only Mount

#### WP-04-01: Linux FUSE Adapter Skeleton

Status:

- Adapter skeleton implemented in `wmapp-core`. `mount --dry-run` renders the read-only Drive tree from local SQLite metadata, and non-dry-run `mount` now enters the FUSE/macFUSE foreground mount path after host preflight. Mounted file reads use the cache first and hydrate from Tower on cache miss when Tower auth is configured. On the current Mac host, macFUSE 5.2.0 is installed but the kernel device cannot be loaded yet, so live `ls` acceptance remains blocked by host macFUSE approval/loading rather than missing adapter code.

Scope:

- Add Linux FUSE adapter.
- Mount and unmount a local `~/FlightDeck` filesystem from the core.

Deliverable:

- Empty or fixture-backed mount works on Linux.

Acceptance:

- `ls ~/FlightDeck` returns without errors.
- Mount and unmount are controlled by CLI or local API.

Current validation:

- `cargo test` passes with projection, mount-tree, and provider-backed file read coverage.
- Live dry-run on macOS after `sync --once` projected `/Wingman Suite/Wingman App/wmapp-readonly-open-me.txt` from Tower-backed metadata with `local_state: cached` and `size_bytes: 271`.
- `wmapp-core cat` hydrated the same file from Tower into the local cache and wrote an openable read-only preview file at `~/FlightDeck-readonly-preview/Wingman Suite/Wingman App/wmapp-readonly-open-me.txt`.
- Host macFUSE check on 2026-07-01 found `/Library/Filesystems/macfuse.fs`, package receipts, and `mount_macfuse` version `5.2.0` under `/Library/Filesystems/macfuse.fs/Contents/Resources/`.
- Running `mount` without `--dry-run` on 2026-07-03 fails closed at macOS preflight: `/Library/Filesystems/macfuse.fs/Contents/Resources/load_macfuse` exits `1`, and no `/dev/macfuse*`, `/dev/osxfuse*`, or `/dev/fuse*` device is present. Real `ls` acceptance is not passed on this host until macFUSE can load.

#### WP-04-02: Metadata Projection To Mount Tree

Status:

- Implemented through the shared projection module. The dry-run tree maps workspace-local scopes, channels, folders, and files into user-facing paths and includes cached file size metadata where available.
- Board state may still read `new`; the committed projection work landed under the active `WP-04-01`/`WP-04-03` slices because it was needed before live kernel acceptance could be completed.

Scope:

- Project workspace, scope, channel, folder, and file metadata into filesystem paths.

Deliverable:

- Read-only directory tree from local SQLite metadata.

Acceptance:

- `find ~/FlightDeck -maxdepth 4` shows expected Tower-backed hierarchy.

#### WP-04-03: Lazy Read And Range Hydration

Scope:

- Implement file open/read by fetching missing ranges from Tower into cache.

Deliverable:

- Opening a file hydrates content on demand.

Acceptance:

- Files are visible before content is downloaded.
- Reopening hydrated content uses cache.

Current validation:

- Implemented as cache-first full-object hydration in the FUSE read provider. Byte-range-specific hydration remains a later optimization.
- `cargo test` includes provider-backed read coverage.
- Live `wmapp-core cat` hydrated `wmapp-readonly-open-me.txt` from Tower, then `mount --dry-run` projected it as cached with a 271-byte size.

#### WP-04-04: Doc URL Entries And Read-Only Validation

Scope:

- Expose Flight Deck docs as `.flightdeck.url` entries.
- Validate read-only desktop behavior.

Deliverable:

## First Worker-Friendly Milestones

Milestone A: Tower Contract Audit

- Workdir: `~/code/wingmanbefree/wingman-tower`.
- Deliverable: `wm-app` API gap document or Tower issue/task.
- No client code required.
- Status: Complete in `bbd7958`.

Milestone B: Core CLI Prototype

- Workdir: `~/code/wingmanbefree/wm-app`.
- Deliverable: Rust CLI can sign NIP-98 and list Tower files.
- No Flutter required.
- Status: Complete. Device-key signing, Tower listing, SQLite persistence, local item listing, cache hydration, pinning, and eviction are implemented through `WP-02-05`.

Milestone C: Flutter Signer Browser Prototype

- Workdir: `~/code/wingmanbefree/wm-app`.
- Deliverable: Flutter WebView injects `window.nostr` and signs a test NIP-98 request.
- No filesystem required.

Milestone D: Linux Read-Only Drive

- Workdir: `~/code/wingmanbefree/wm-app`.
- Deliverable: FUSE mount lists and lazily opens Tower files.
- No write support required.

Milestone E: macOS Read-Only Drive

- Workdir: `~/code/wingmanbefree/wm-app`.
- Deliverable: macFUSE or File Provider proof of the same read-only flow.

## Risks

- Tower file API may not yet expose stable folder/file/version/delta semantics.
- macOS File Provider has more platform ceremony than macFUSE.
- Mobile file providers have stricter lifecycle limits than desktop daemons.
- WebView injection differs by platform and may require platform-specific plugin code.
- Key custody and signer permissions must be conservative from the start.
- Offline edits and conflicts can become complex; defer until read-only sync is proven.

## Recommended Next Step

Continue the read-only desktop mount path:

1. Keep macFUSE host validation in the test loop; the current Mac has macFUSE 5.2.0 installed.
2. Implement the kernel FUSE/macFUSE adapter against the existing `DriveProjection`.
3. Add file stat support for online-only files, using Tower byte-range metadata where needed so placeholders can report real size without full hydration.
4. Wire file reads to the existing cache-first `cat`/hydration path.

Keep production write sync behind `WP-06-01`, `WP-06-02`, and `WP-06-03`; keep production WApp signer policy behind `WP-10-01`.
